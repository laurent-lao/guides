# Laurent's Setup

* [My repos](https://github.com/laurentlaurent?tab=repositories)

## Computer

I am a big fan of macOS with its Terminal, scripting capabilities and host of applications that support [global shortcuts](#global-shortcuts). I use a laptop with an second monitor and often use Sidecar with my iPad Pro to have a third screen (or a second one on the go). I also have a thunderbolt dock at home which gives me a 1 cable solution to connect everything up when I get home.

## Keyboards

I am using two ortholinear keyboards: the ErgoDox EZ (a split ortholinear keybooard) and the Preonic Rev 3. On a staggered QWERTY keyboard, the `A` key is slightly to the right of the `Q` key; all keys are slightly staggered from each other. On a ortholinear keyboard, all keys are aligned in a vertical fashion (but may be not lined up horizontally).

I kept the layout of both keyboards largely the same, with modifications such as holding the `F` key to act as a `cmd`, holding the `;` key to transform `I, J, K, L` into arrow keys and having my `backspace` and `enter` surrounding the `space` key.
