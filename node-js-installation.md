# Node.js Installation

* Install nvm (you might have to edit your `.zshrc`)

* Type `nvm install node` (might have to be in sudo for this) or alternatively, `nvm install x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the node version you want to install.

* Then, run `nvm install-latest-npm`.

* If there is an existing repo with node, then I would recommend cloning the repo, navigating to the checkout folder and to run `npm install` to install the packages outlined in the `package.json`.

* If not, then you might want to install Angular and/or React globally
